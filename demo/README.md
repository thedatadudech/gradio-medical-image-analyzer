## Features Demonstrated

1. **File Upload Support**
   - DICOM files (.dcm, .dicom)
   - Standard image formats (PNG, JPG, TIFF, BMP)
   - Files without extensions (e.g., IM_0001)

2. **Analysis Tasks**
   - üéØ Point Analysis - Analyze specific ROI in the image
   - üî¨ Fat Segmentation - CT-specific fat tissue analysis
   - üìä Full Analysis - Comprehensive image analysis

3. **Modality Support**
   - CT (Computed Tomography)
   - CR (Computed Radiography)
   - DX/RX/DR (Digital X-ray variants)

4. **Interactive Features**
   - ROI selection with sliders
   - Clinical context input
   - Overlay visualization
   - Real-time analysis

## Sample Workflow

1. Upload a medical image (DICOM or standard format)
2. Select the imaging modality (auto-detected for DICOM)
3. Choose an analysis task
4. Adjust ROI if needed
5. Click "Analyze" to get results

## Output Formats

- **Visual Report**: HTML-formatted analysis results
- **JSON Output**: Structured data for AI agents and integration
- **Overlay View**: Visual annotations on the original image

## Development Notes

- The demo uses a dark medical theme optimized for clinical environments
- All processing is done locally - no data is sent to external servers
- The component is designed for both human interpretation and AI agent integration

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Check that you have the correct Python version (3.8+)
3. For DICOM files, ensure they are valid medical images
